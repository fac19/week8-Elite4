# Week-8 - The Elite 4 :cherry_blossom: 
## The Pokemon Choose You!
The dog days are over.

We created an app where you can see a list of pokemon and their names. If you sign in you can also create a pokemon and add it to the list. Yay!

The [project is deployed here](https://fac19-pokemon.netlify.app/) and talks to this [REST API](https://github.com/Chloeh24/pokemonAPI) which was cloned from [Oli's doggy API](https://fac19-pokemon.netlify.app/). :dog:

To run the project locally:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm i` on your terminal to install dependencies
3. Grab a cool beverage. Sit back, relax. It's Friday baby.

## What can you do?
### Signed out you can
- GET request for all pokemon on homepage.
- Make POST requests and sign up or log in.

### Signed in you can 
- Make a POST request to add a new pokemon.
- Make a GET request to see your pokemon!

## Help us code reviewers!
- Struggling to understand what [servor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/servor) does. Also, why will the project deploy on Netlify but not GitHub pages..? What is a server again?
